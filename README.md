## A flexible, constraint-aware task scheduler for order fulfillment scenarios involving multiple resources/accounts, daily limits, and time-based dependencies.

## Features

- Multi-resource (account) task balancing
- Daily/periodic per-resource caps
- Minimum delay windows between sequential tasks (e.g., purchase â†’ review)
- Automatic rescheduling for missed or delayed tasks
- Audit log for scheduling decisions and changes
- Simple API for integration with bots, web dashboards, and order management systems

## Example Use Case

**Amazon Review Fulfillment:**

- 5 Amazon accounts
- Max 3 purchases/account/day
- No more than 1 purchase of same book per account per day
- Each review published min. 4 days after purchase
- Rescheduling on missed events

## Core problem

- The fundamental goal is to schedule book purchases and reviews, respecting various constraints (account limits, book-per-day limits, review delays) while minimizing overall completion time

## Key Entities:

- Order: Contains multiple OrderLines.
- OrderLine: Represents a request for a specific Book and a Review to be written for it. Could be multiple OrderLines for the same book in an order or across orders.
- Book: Identified by something unique (e.g., ASIN).
- AmazonAccount: Has a daily purchase limit.
- PurchaseTask: A specific book to be bought by a specific account on a specific day.
- ReviewTask: A review to be posted for a specific purchased book on a specific day.
- Schedule: The overall plan, containing all PurchaseTasks and ReviewTasks.

## DSs:

- Order: order_id, list_of_order_lines.
- OrderLine: book_id (or book_asin), client_id, review_text_placeholder.
- AmazonAccount: account_id, daily_purchase_limit (initially 3).
- PurchaseTask: date, account_id, book_id, order_id, order_line_id, status (PENDING, COMPLETED, MISSED).
- ReviewTask: date, purchase_task_id, book_id, order_id, order_line_id, status.
- Schedule: Maybe a dictionary mapping dates to lists of tasks, or separate lists for purchase and review tasks. A list of PurchaseTask objects and ReviewTask objects seems most flexible.
